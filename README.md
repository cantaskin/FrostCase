The game starts with a 10x10 grid. Players can change the grid size and the number of animals using the user interface.

To begin, you need to press the 'Turn' button. Each turn, cats hunt mice in all four directions. If cats can't find any mice nearby, they move randomly. Cats can have babies every 7 turns, and if they're hungry for 3 turns straight, they die.

Mice move randomly to one of the four empty spaces nearby each turn. If there are no empty spaces around them, they stay put. Mice can have babies every 3 turns and if there are no unoccupied spaces adjacent to the parent, then breeding is postponed until space is available in another turn like cats.
